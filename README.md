## Introduction
This repository is aimed at JavaScript developers and students who want to strengthen their understanding of
data structures and algorithms. Each implementation includes clear explanations and examples, making it a
valuable resource for learning and reference.
## Features
- Implementations of common data structures (e.g., Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs)
- Popular algorithms (e.g., Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Dynamic Programming)
- Example problems with solutions for practice
- Clear code structure and comments for easy understanding
## Installation
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rajatsingh900k/DSA-with-JS.git
```
Navigate into the project folder:
```bash
cd DSA-with-JS
```
## Usage
Each data structure and algorithm is organized into separate folders. You can explore each folder to see the
individual implementations and example problems.
1. **Navigate** to the specific directory, such as `Sorting` for sorting algorithms.
2. **Run the JavaScript files** using Node.js:
```bash
node sorting/quickSort.js
```
3. **Experiment** with the examples and try modifying inputs to test your understanding.
## Data Structures
- **Arrays**: Basic operations, searching, and sorting techniques.
- **Linked Lists**: Singly linked list, doubly linked list, and operations.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Stack and queue implementations using arrays and linked lists.
- **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees, and tree traversal algorithms.
- **Graphs**: Graph representation, depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS).
## Algorithms
- **Sorting**: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort
- **Searching**: Linear Search, Binary Search
- **Recursion**: Factorials, Fibonacci, and basic recursion problems
- **Dynamic Programming**: Sample problems like knapsack, Fibonacci with memoization
- **Graph Algorithms**: DFS, BFS, shortest path algorithms
